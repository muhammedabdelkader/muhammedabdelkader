Muhammed is a security engineer by day and a hacker by night. With over 12 years of experience in offensive security, Muhammed has the skills to break into any system, but chooses to use their powers for good by helping organizations strengthen their security posture. When not saving the world from cyber attacks, Muhammed can be found trying to figure out how to fit a full-sized keyboard into their pocket, or searching for the perfect burrito.
